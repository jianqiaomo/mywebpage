Welcome to Jianqiao Mo's page! 
I'm an ECE PhD student at New York University ([BAAHL](https://wp.nyu.edu/baahl/)), 
advised by [Brandon Reagen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen)
and also collaborating with [Siddharth Garg](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg).

My research focuses on hardware acceleration for cryptography, 
with the goal of advancing end-to-end data privacy and integrity.

### Privacy-Preserving Computation for End-To-End Data Privacy

I am developing specialized hardware systems to accelerate **privacy-preserving computation**
([secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)).

My work includes accelerators for cryptographic protocols (particularly Garbled Circuits (GC) [1,2]).

It is useful for enabling "private inference" in machine learning.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Data Integrity

I am also working on hardware accelerators for **zero-knowledge proofs** (zkp), which allow the verification 
of data integrity by proving the correctness of computations without revealing the underlying data.

Before NYU, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Nanjing University where
I worked as a research intern advised by Prof. [Zhongfeng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=faC-qekAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
My research there focused on reducing the computational cost of deep neural networks by 
optimizing dynamic exit branches.
